# UmlSequenceToClassConverter

A small software to extract a basic `plantuml` class diagram from a `plantuml` **sequence** diagram.

Should be improved afterwards.


## TODO

- add a field for the original class diagram, which should be used as basis
- automatically remove intermediary `@startuml` and `@enduml` tags ?
- add another panel for global class diagram consolidation.

## Future

Allow the use of the whole markdown file as entry. In this case, 
it should be possible to select what diagrams to use as basis,
and then to copy the result.
